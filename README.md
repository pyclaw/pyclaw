# PyClaw

**PyClaw** is a secure, extensible AI assistant platform written in **Python** — designed both as a personal assistant and as a **multi-user assistant for teams/organizations** (an AI “employee”) with strong user/tenant isolation.

## What it aims to be
- **Security & isolation first** (multi-tenant by design).
- **Web UI first**: a small **React/TypeScript** frontend available as a **Telegram Mini App** and as a standalone website (Telegram integration is optional).
- **Pluggable communication gateways**: not tied to one messenger or interface.
- **Immutable core + mutable overlays** (backend + frontend): the core is kept stable for updates, while mutable parts can be written/extended by the agent to fit a user/team — and may override most of the core.

Inspired by **OpenClaw** and intended to cover similar “personal assistant” capabilities over time.

## Status
Early-stage idea / prototype. Expect breaking changes.
